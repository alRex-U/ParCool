# Wall Slide

You may sometimes want to jump off from high place.
[Breakfall](breakfall.md) can reduce the falling damage, but there is a limit. Too long falling cause you death even if
you do breakfall.

However if there are wall nearby you, you may be possible to survive, by **Wall Slide**.

You can slow down fall velocity by cling to wall, and reduce or completely eliminate the falling damage.

This action is affected by the slipperiness of blocks,
so it can be less effective with wall made of ice block.

Be careful, you may take damage when you try to decline too much fall speed.
