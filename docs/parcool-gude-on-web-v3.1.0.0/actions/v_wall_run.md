# Wall Run

You can jump vertically using a wall, to get over it. But if wall is slippery, you cannot.

Don't mistake this for [Horizontal Wall Run](./h_wall_run.md).

### How to use

1. Look above horizontal line take running up with [Dash](dash.md)
2. Jump onto wall with not releasing jump key.

It may be little difficult but try it.
